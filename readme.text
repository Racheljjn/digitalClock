Please note: this app only has desktop version, if you open it via mobile, you will see a broken app. Sorry, I just want to practise javascript, so I didn't add responsive design. 

a vitual clock project
new Date function to get current time object: getHours, getMinutes and getSeconds

put all these functions inside of one function timer(), and call timer every one second, which the time will be updated
